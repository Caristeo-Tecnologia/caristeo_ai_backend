    IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:

      - Use ## for page titles and main headings
      - Use ### for section titles and subheadings
      - Format article numbers (like "ART. 2Â°") in **bold** (using standard Markdown bold)
      - Use proper paragraph spacing with blank lines between paragraphs
      - Use Markdown lists for enumerated items
      - Use > for indented or quoted text sections
    - Use standard Markdown bold formatting with two asterisks (\*\*) for emphasized text
    - If a word is split between lines, write it as a single word (e.g., "Palavra" instead of "Pala-vra")
    - Do not describe what you're doing or what the image contains
    - Do not use any HTML formatting, stick to pure Markdown syntax
